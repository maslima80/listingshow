# ✅ Fresh Project Setup Complete!

## What We've Built (Day 1 - Foundation)

### 🎯 Project Structure
- ✅ Fresh Next.js 15 project with App Router
- ✅ TypeScript configured
- ✅ Tailwind CSS 4 ready
- ✅ All dependencies installed (440 packages)

### 🗄 Database Architecture
Created complete team-based schema with 13 tables:

**Core Tables:**
- `users` - Authentication
- `teams` - Main account (solo/multi mode)
- `team_members` - User-team relationships
- `agent_profiles` - Display profiles

**Property System:**
- `properties` - Listings with all details
- `property_agents` - Many-to-many agent assignments
- `media_assets` - Photos and videos

**Hub System (Link-in-Bio):**
- `hub_pages` - Team hub pages
- `hub_blocks` - Content blocks (property, link, image, video, text)

**Theme & Billing:**
- `themes` - Theme definitions
- `team_themes` - Team theme selections
- `subscriptions` - Stripe integration
- `team_usage` - Usage tracking

### 🔐 Authentication
- ✅ NextAuth.js configured
- ✅ Credentials provider (email/password)
- ✅ Google OAuth ready (needs credentials)
- ✅ Team context in session
- ✅ JWT strategy with team data

### 🛠 Utilities Created
- ✅ Slug validation with reserved words
- ✅ Slug suggestion generator
- ✅ Currency formatting
- ✅ Area formatting (sqm/sqft)
- ✅ Trial days calculator
- ✅ Plan limits configuration

## 🎨 Database Schema Highlights

### Team-Centric Design
Every property, hub page, and subscription belongs to a **team**, not a user. This allows:
- Solo agents (1-person teams)
- Multi-agent teams
- Flexible agent assignments
- Proper permission management

### URL Structure
- `/u/<teamSlug>` - Hub pages (link-in-bio)
- `/p/<propertySlug>` - Property pages (globally unique)

### Key Features Built In
- **Slug uniqueness** - Team slugs globally unique, property slugs unique per team
- **Agent profiles** - Can exist with or without user accounts
- **Property agents** - Many-to-many with primary agent designation
- **Hub blocks** - Flexible content system with 5 block types
- **Theme system** - Dark/Light modes with accent colors
- **Usage tracking** - Properties live count + video minutes

## 📋 Next Steps (What You Need to Do)

### 1. Database Setup
You need to provide your Neon database URL:

```bash
# Create .env file
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host/database
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here-generate-with-openssl
```

Generate NEXTAUTH_SECRET:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### 2. Run Migrations
Once you have the DATABASE_URL:

```bash
# Generate migration files
npm run db:generate

# Push schema to database
npm run db:push
```

### 3. Optional: Google OAuth
If you want Google sign-in:
1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
3. Add to .env:
```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

### 4. Start Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🚀 What We'll Build Next

### Phase 1A: Authentication (Next Session)
- Sign-up page with email/password
- Sign-in page
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Session management

### Phase 1B: Onboarding Flow
- Step 1: Mode selection (solo vs multi)
- Step 2: Slug claim with validation
- Team creation
- Agent profile creation
- Default theme assignment
- Trial period setup (14 days)

### Phase 1C: Dashboard
- Card-based layout
- Create Property card
- Your Hub card
- Agents card (if multi mode)
- Branding & Theme card
- Billing & Usage card

## 📊 Architecture Decisions Made

### Why Team-Based?
- Supports both solo agents and multi-agent teams
- Easier to add team members later
- Proper separation of concerns
- Scalable for agency use cases

### Why Separate Agent Profiles?
- Agents can be added without user accounts
- Flexible for showcasing team members
- Can link to users later
- Better for property assignments

### Why Hub Pages?
- Link-in-bio functionality
- Showcase all properties in one place
- Flexible content blocks
- Professional team presence

### Why This Tech Stack?
- **Next.js 15** - Latest features, App Router, RSC
- **Drizzle ORM** - Type-safe, fast, great DX
- **NextAuth** - Industry standard, flexible
- **Tailwind + shadcn/ui** - Fast development, beautiful UI
- **Neon** - Serverless Postgres, great for MVP

## 🎯 Success Criteria

By end of Day 1, we should have:
- [x] Clean project structure
- [x] Database schema complete
- [x] Auth configuration ready
- [ ] Database migrations applied
- [ ] First page rendering

## 💡 Tips for Development

### Database Changes
Always use Drizzle migrations:
```bash
# 1. Edit lib/db/schema.ts
# 2. Generate migration
npm run db:generate
# 3. Review migration in drizzle/ folder
# 4. Apply to database
npm run db:push
```

### Debugging
```bash
# Open Drizzle Studio to view database
npm run db:studio
```

### Code Organization
- **app/** - Pages and routes
- **components/** - Reusable React components
- **lib/** - Utilities, config, database
- **hooks/** - Custom React hooks

## 📞 Ready to Continue?

Once you have your DATABASE_URL, we can:
1. Generate and apply migrations
2. Seed initial theme data
3. Build the sign-up page
4. Build the onboarding flow
5. Create the dashboard
