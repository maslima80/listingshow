  - `bio` = short (2-3 sentences) for cards
  - `bio_long` = extended for About block
  - `stats_json` = { years_in_business, homes_sold, volume }
  - `credentials` = array of strings (certifications/awards)
  - `service_areas` = array of neighborhood IDs
  - `social_links` = { instagram, facebook, linkedin, youtube, tiktok, website }
