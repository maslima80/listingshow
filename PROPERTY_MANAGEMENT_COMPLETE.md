# Property Management - Complete ✅

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Dashboard Display Issue
**Problem**: Properties were being created but not displayed on the dashboard.

**Solution**: Updated `/app/dashboard/page.tsx` to properly render property cards when properties exist, with conditional rendering that shows either:
- Property grid with cards (when properties exist)
- Empty state with call-to-action (when no properties)

### 2. Property Cards
**Created**: New `PropertyCard` component (`/components/property-card.tsx`) with:
- Premium card design with hover effects
- Cover image/video display
- Property details (price, beds, baths, sqft, location)
- Status badge (Published/Draft)
- Action buttons (View, Delete)
- Delete confirmation dialog

### 3. Delete Functionality
**Created**: Delete API endpoint (`/app/api/properties/[id]/delete/route.ts`) that:
- Verifies user ownership
- Deletes media files from disk
- Removes database records (with cascade for related data)
- Returns success/error responses

**Features**:
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- Loading states during deletion
- Automatic page refresh after deletion
- Error handling with user feedback

## Current Flow

### Property Creation
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/properties/new`
2. Upload media (photos/videos)
3. Select hero image/video
4. Fill property details (name, price, location)
5. Add stats (beds, baths, parking, sqft)
6. Select amenities/highlights
7. Add description (optional)
8. Select agents
9. Click "Publish Property"
10. Redirects to public property page at `/p/[slug]`

### Property Management
1. View all properties on dashboard at `/dashboard`
2. Each property card shows:
   - Cover image/video
   - Title, price, location
   - Key stats
   - Status badge
3. Actions available:
   - **View**: Opens public property page
   - **Delete**: Removes property with confirmation

## File Structure

```
/app
  /dashboard
    page.tsx                          # Dashboard with property grid
    /properties
      /new
        page.tsx                      # Property creation page
  /api
    /properties
      /create
        route.ts                      # Create property API
      /[id]
        /delete
          route.ts                    # Delete property API
  /p
    /[slug]
      page.tsx                        # Public property page

/components
  property-creator.tsx                # Property creation form
  property-card.tsx                   # Property card with delete
  /ui
    alert-dialog.tsx                  # Confirmation dialog component
```
