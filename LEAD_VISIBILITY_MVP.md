# Lead Visibility + Bottom Contact Form MVP

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### Overview
Enhanced the Lead CRM system with real-time visibility, mobile-first UI, and a bottom contact form on public property pages.

---

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. Lead Count API
**File:** `/app/api/leads/count/route.ts`

- `GET /api/leads/count?status=new` returns `{ count: number }`
- Team-scoped (requires authentication)
- Supports filtering by status (new, contacted, in_progress, closed)
- Used by polling hook and dashboard components

### 2. Real-Time Polling Hook
**File:** `/hooks/use-lead-count.ts`

**Features:**
- Polls every 30 seconds (configurable)
- Pauses when tab is hidden (visibility API)
- Abort controller for cleanup
- `onCountIncrease` callback for toast notifications
- Returns `{ count, loading, error }`

**Usage:**
```typescript
const { count } = useLeadCount({
  status: 'new',
  interval: 30000,
  onCountIncrease: (newCount, oldCount) => {
    // Show toast notification
  }
})
```

### 3. Global Navigation with Bell Badge
**File:** `/components/dashboard-nav.tsx`

**Features:**
- Bell icon in header (visible on all dashboard pages)
- Red badge with count (max "9+")
- Clicking navigates to `/dashboard/leads?status=new`
- Toast notification when new leads arrive
- Only shows toast after initial load (prevents spam on page load)

**Theming:**
- Red badge background (`bg-red-500`)
- White text for high contrast
- Hover effect on bell icon

### 4. Dashboard Leads Card Enhancement
**File:** `/components/leads-card.tsx`

**Features:**
- Green "New • {count}" badge (hidden when 0)
- Last lead preview: "John S. • 2 min ago"
- Shows property title and lead type (🗓️ Tour or 💬 Message)
- Auto-refreshes when new leads arrive
- Fetches last lead with `limit=1` parameter

### 5. Dashboard Layout Wrapper
**Files:**
- `/components/dashboard-client.tsx` - Wrapper component
- Updated `/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Uses wrapper
- Updated `/app/dashboard/leads/page.tsx` - Uses wrapper

**Features:**
- Consistent navigation across all dashboard pages
- Toaster component included
- Removes duplicate headers

### 6. Mobile-First Leads Page
**File:** `/components/leads-client.tsx`

**New Features:**
- **Segmented Filters** (horizontal scroll on mobile):
  - All
  - New (with count badge)
  - 🗓️ Tours
  - 💬 Messages
- Pill-style buttons with active states
- Color-coded: Blue (New), Green (Tours), Purple (Messages)
- Removed dropdown selects (desktop-only pattern)
- Reads `?status=new` from URL on load

**Theming:**
- Active: Colored background with white text
- Inactive: Light gray background with dark text
- Smooth transitions

### 7. Bottom Contact Form (Public)
**File:** `/components/public/BottomContactForm.tsx`

**Features:**
- Placed in EndCredits section (below External Links)
- Fields: Name*, Email*, Phone (opt), Message (opt)
- Submits to `POST /api/leads` with `type='message'` and `source='bottom_form'`
- Success state: Checkmark icon + "Thanks! We'll reach out shortly."
- Auto-hides success message after 5 seconds
- Toast notification on submit
- Theme-aware (uses accent color)

**Copy:**
- Header: "Have a question about {PropertyTitle}?"
- Description: "Send us a message and we'll get back to you soon"
- Button: "Send Message"
- Success: "Thanks! We'll reach out shortly."

### 8. Updated EndCredits Component
**File:** `/components/public/EndCredits.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `propertyId` prop
- Includes `BottomContactForm` component
- Positioned after External Links, before Contact Card (desktop)
- Mobile: Full width, stacks naturally
- Desktop: Left column (2/3 width)

---

## 📱 Mobile-First Design

### Segmented Filters
- Horizontal scroll with `overflow-x-auto`
- `scrollbar-hide` utility (already in globals.css)
- Touch-friendly pill buttons
- No dropdowns (mobile anti-pattern)

### Lead Cards
- Compact, tappable
- Inline status updates
- Detail modal (not implemented in this MVP, but ready)

### Bottom Contact Form
- Full-width on mobile
- Large touch targets
- Inline validation errors
- Success state without reload

---

## 🔔 Notification Flow

### When New Lead Arrives:

1. **Polling detects increase** (every 30s)
2. **Bell badge updates** (e.g., "3" → "4")
3. **Dashboard card updates** (New badge + last lead preview)
4. **Toast appears** (if on dashboard pages):
   - Title: "New lead received!"
   - Description: "You have {count} new leads."
   - Action: "View" link to `/dashboard/leads?status=new`

### Visibility Check:
- Polling pauses when tab is hidden
- Resumes immediately when tab becomes visible
- Prevents unnecessary API calls

---

## 🎨 Theming

### Bell Badge
- Background: `bg-red-500` (high urgency)
- Text: White
- Position: Absolute top-right of bell icon

### Leads Card Badge
- Background: `bg-green-600`
- Text: White
- Format: "New • {count}"

### Segmented Filters

- **Tours**: Green bg when active (`bg-green-600`)
- **Messages**: Purple bg when active (`bg-purple-600`)
- **Inactive**: Light gray (`bg-slate-100`)

### Bottom Contact Form
- Uses `accentColor` prop for submit button
- Success checkmark uses `accentColor` with 20% opacity background
- Matches property page theme
