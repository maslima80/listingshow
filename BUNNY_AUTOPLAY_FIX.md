# Bunny.net Autoplay Fix

## Problem
Videos were loading in the fullscreen player but required an extra click to start playing - bad UX.

## Root Cause
Bunny.net iframe embeds were using `autoplay=false` parameter, which meant:
1. User clicks "Watch the Film" ‚Üí Player opens
2. Video loads but shows play button overlay
3. User must click play button again ‚Üí Video starts

This created an unnecessary extra click.

## Solution
Changed all Bunny.net video URLs to use `autoplay=true` parameter.

## Changes Made

### 1. `/lib/bunny.ts`
**Lines 114, 123, 227:**
- Changed `autoplay=false` to `autoplay=true` in all URL generation
- New videos uploaded will automatically have autoplay enabled

### 2. `/components/public/CinematicPlayer.tsx`
**Lines 139-154:**
- Simplified iframe rendering (removed autoplay URL manipulation)
- Videos now autoplay immediately when player opens

### 3. `/app/api/debug/fix-bunny-urls/route.ts`
**Updated to fix existing videos:**
- Now finds videos with `autoplay=false` parameter
- Updates them to `autoplay=true`
- Fixed 2 existing videos in database

## New URL Format

**Before:**
```
https://iframe.mediadelivery.net/embed/516385/{videoId}?autoplay=false&preload=true
```

**After:**
```
https://iframe.mediadelivery.net/embed/516385/{videoId}?autoplay=true&preload=true
```

## User Experience Now

1. ‚úÖ User clicks "Watch the Film" ‚Üí Player opens
2. ‚úÖ Video starts playing immediately
3. ‚úÖ No extra click required!

## Testing

1. **Refresh your property page** (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Click "Watch the Film"** or click a video card
3. **Video should start playing immediately** üéâ

## Browser Autoplay Policies

Modern browsers have autoplay restrictions:
- ‚úÖ **Works:** User-initiated actions (clicks, taps)
- ‚ùå **Blocked:** Automatic playback on page load

Since our videos play after a user click, autoplay will work in all browsers!

## Future Videos

All new videos uploaded will automatically have `autoplay=true`, so this is a one-time fix.
